    "## This is an individual exam. Do not work with a partner! Only change \"submitter\" netid information. Good luck.\n",
    "- For majority of the questions you need to replace \"# Write your code here\" comment with your own code.\n",
    "- There are 27 questions, each of which will be weighted 0.55 points.\n",
    "- Unlike projects, you will receive partial credit for a question as long as your code runs and produces an output for each question.\n",
    "- Unlike projects, you do not have access to \"test.py\". Instead, you can use \"type_test.py\". This file does not check if your answers are correct, but it checks if your answers are in the correct format.\n",
    "- \"test.py\" will run \"lint.py\" and deduct points for linting errors. You will lose 0.1 points for each linting error. You will only lose points for warnings, not convention messages (just like in P10). type_test.py does not run the linter, so check with lint.py before turning your work in. For more information about the linter as well as how to run the full linter to see all of the automatically generated advice and feedback, please check out the linting README: https://github.com/msyamkumar/cs220-projects/tree/master/linter.\n",
    "- General hint: if you see a lot of hints / write up before a question, it is likely to be difficult question."
