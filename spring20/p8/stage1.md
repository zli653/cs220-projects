# Stage 1: Data Plumbing

A lot of data science work often involves *plumbing*, the process of
getting messy data into a more useful format.  Data plumbing is the
focus of stage 1.  We'll develop and test three functions that will be
helpful in stage 2:

1. `get_mapping(path)`: this loads a file that can be used to lookup names from IDs
2. `get_raw_movies(path)`: this loads movie data with info represented using IDs
3. `get_movies(movies_path, mapping_path)`: this uses the other two functions to load movie data, then replace IDs with names

---

Start by writing a function that starts like this:

```python
def get_mapping(path):
```

When called, the `path` should refer to one of the mapping files
(e.g., "small_mapping.csv").  The function should return a dictionary
that maps IDs (as keys) to names (as values), based on the file
referenced by `path`.  For example, this code:

```python
mapping = get_mapping("small_mapping.csv")
print(mapping)
```

Should print this:

```
{
  "nm0000131": "John Cusack",
  "nm0000154": "Mel Gibson",
  "nm0000163": "Dustin Hoffman",
  "nm0000418": "Danny Glover",
  "nm0000432": "Gene Hackman",
  "nm0000997": "Gary Busey",
  "nm0001149": "Richard Donner",
  "nm0001219": "Gary Fleder",
  "nm0752751": "Mitchell Ryan",
  "tt0093409": "Lethal Weapon",
  "tt0313542": "Runaway Jury"
}
```

Note that the mapping files do not have a CSV header, so hardcoding
the column indexes is OK in this case.

The following questions pertain to `small_mapping.csv` unless
otherwise specified.

---

#### #Q1: What is returned by your `get_mapping("small_mapping.csv")` function?

In addition to displaying the result in the `Out [N]` area, keep the
result in a variable for use in subsequent questions.

#### #Q2: What is the value associated with the key "nm0001219"?

Use the dictionary returned earlier. Do not call `get_mapping` a
second time (that would be inneficient).

#### #Q3: What are the values in the mapping associated with keys beginning with "nm"?

Answer with a Python list.

#### #Q4: Which keys in the mapping map to people with a last name which starts with "G"?

Answer with a Python list. To get full points, you should write code
that will count only last names that start with "G". You should ignore names that
contain "G" in other places.

---

Build a function named `get_raw_movies` that takes a path to a movies
CSV (e.g., "small_movies.csv" or "movies.csv") as a parameter and
returns a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a
movie as follows:

```python
{ 
    "title": "movie-id",
    "year": <the year as an integer>,
    "rating": <the rating as a float>,
    "directors": ["director-id1", "director-id2", ...],
    "actors": ["actor-id1", "actor-id2", ....], 
    "genres": ["genre1", "genre2", ...]
}
```

Note that the movie files DO have a CSV header.  You must use it to
find the indexes (hardcoding 0, 1, etc will lose you points).

Also note that the values for `directors`, `actors`, and ```genres```
always contain lists, even if those lists contain a single value.

---

#### #Q5: What does `get_raw_movies("small_movies.csv")` return?

The result should be this:
```
[{'title': 'tt0313542',
  'year': 2003,
  'rating': 7.1,
  'directors': ['nm0001219'],
  'actors': ['nm0000131', 'nm0000432', 'nm0000163'],
  'genres': ['Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']},
 {'title': 'tt0093409',
  'year': 1987,
  'rating': 7.6,
  'directors': ['nm0001149'],
  'actors': ['nm0000154', 'nm0000418', 'nm0000997', 'nm0752751'],
  'genres': ['Action', 'Crime', 'Thriller']}]
```

Also, keep the value returned by `get_raw_movies` in a variable.  You
should not call the function more often than necessary (in other
words, keep the returned data structures in a variable to re-use for
multiple questions).

#### #Q6: How many actors did the movie at index 1 have?

Use the data from Q5.

#### #Q7: What is the ID of the first actor listed for the move at index 0?

Use the data from Q5.

---

Note that for the keys `actors`, `directors`, and `title`, we
currently only use IDs instead of actual names. Write a function named
`get_movies(movies_path, mapping_path)` that loads data from the
`movies_path` file using `get_movies_raw` and converts the IDs to
names using a mapping based on the `mapping_path` file, which you
should load using your `get_mapping` function.

Each dictionary in the list should look something like this:

```python
{
    "title": "the movie name",
    "year": <the year as an integer>,
    "rating": <the rating as a float>,
    "directors": ["director-name1", "director-name2", ...],
    "actors": ["actor-name1", "actor-name2", ....], 
    "genres": ["genre1", "genre2", ...]
}
```

Notice the difference between the previous one and this (names instead
of IDs). This list of dictionaries is vital for almost all of the
following questions.

We recommend you get the translation from ID to name working for title
before you start trying to translate actors and directors.

After you implement your function (or implement enough of it to answer
some of the below questions), call it and store the result in `movies`
as follows:

```python
small = get_movies("small_movies.csv", "small_mapping.csv")
```

---

#### #Q8: what is `small[1]["title"]`?

Just paste `small[1]["title"]` into a cell and run it.  We're doing
this to check that the structures in `small` (as returned by
`get_movies` above) contain the correct data.

#### #Q9: What is `small[0]["actors"]`?

#### #Q10: What is `small[-1]["directors"]`?

---

If you've gotten this far, your functions must be working pretty well
with the small data.  So let's try the full dataset!

```python
movies = get_movies("movies.csv", "mapping.csv")
```

You are not allowed to call `get_movies` more than once for the
"movies.csv" file in your notebook.  Reuse the `movies` variable
instead (that's more efficient).

---

#### #Q11: What are the last 3 rows in movies?

The result should look like this:

```
[{'title': 'Fortitude and Glory: Angelo Dundee and His Fighters',
  'year': 2012,
  'rating': 7.2,
  'directors': ['Chris Tasara'],
  'actors': ['Angelo Dundee', 'George Foreman', 'Freddie Roach'],
  'genres': ['Sport']},
 {'title': 'Ivanhoe',
  'year': 1952,
  'rating': 6.8,
  'directors': ['Richard Thorpe'],
  'actors': ['Robert Taylor', 'George Sanders'],
  'genres': ['Adventure', 'Drama', 'History']},
 {'title': 'The Great Gatsby',
  'year': 1949,
  'rating': 6.6,
  'directors': ['Elliott Nugent'],
  'actors': ['Alan Ladd', 'Macdonald Carey'],
  'genres': ['Drama']}]
```

#### #Q12: What are the first 2 rows in movies?

The result should look like this:

```
[{'title': 'The Big Wedding',
  'year': 2013,
  'rating': 5.6,
  'directors': ['Justin Zackham'],
  'actors': ['Robert De Niro'],
  'genres': ['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance']},
 {'title': 'The Affair of the Necklace',
  'year': 2001,
  'rating': 6.1,
  'directors': ['Charles Shyer'],
  'actors': ['Simon Baker', 'Jonathan Pryce', 'Adrien Brody'],
  'genres': ['Drama', 'History', 'Romance']}]
```

---

Copy the following function to your notebook, but don't change it in
any way.

```python
# you are not allowed to change this function
def filter_movies_by_year(movies, year):
    i = 0
    while i < len(movies):
        if movies[i]["year"] != year:
            movies.pop(i)
        else:
            i += 1
    return movies
```

The `movies` parameter is for a list of movie dictionaries (similar to
what is retured by `get_movies`) and `year` is a year to filter on.
The function returns the movies in `movies` that were in the given
year.

---

#### #Q13: What are the movies from 1929?

Requirements:
1. Answer using `filter_movies_by_year`
2. Do NOT call `get_movies` on "movies.csv" more than once in your notebook

The answer should look like this:

```
[{'title': 'Redskin',
  'year': 1929,
  'rating': 7.0,
  'directors': ['Victor Schertzinger'],
  'actors': ['Richard Dix', 'Tully Marshall', 'George Regas'],
  'genres': ['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Western']},
 {'title': 'The Girl in the Show',
  'year': 1929,
  'rating': 6.5,
  'directors': ['Edgar Selwyn'],
  'actors': ['Raymond Hackett', 'Edward J. Nugent'],
  'genres': ['Comedy']},
 {'title': 'Atlantic',
  'year': 1929,
  'rating': 5.5,
  'directors': ['Ewald AndrÃ© Dupont'],
  'actors': ['Franklin Dyall', 'John Stuart'],
  'genres': ['Drama']}]
```

#### #Q14: What are the movies from 1931?

**Hint:** we've set you up a bit to encounter a bug.  Review the copy
functions in the `copy` module and see if you can use one of them to
overcome the shortcomings of the `filter_movies_by_year` function
we're forcing you to use.  You might need to go back and tweak your
q14 answer and potentially do a "Restart & Run All" on your notebook
after you've fixed the bug.

If you get it right, you'll get this output:

```
[{'title': 'Arizona',
  'year': 1931,
  'rating': 6.0,
  'directors': ['George B. Seitz'],
  'actors': ['John Wayne', 'Forrest Stanley'],
  'genres': ['Drama', 'Romance']},
 {'title': 'City Lights',
  'year': 1931,
  'rating': 8.5,
  'directors': ['Charles Chaplin'],
  'actors': ['Charles Chaplin', 'Harry Myers'],
  'genres': ['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance']},
 {'title': 'The Range Feud',
  'year': 1931,
  'rating': 5.8,
  'directors': ['D. Ross Lederman'],
  'actors': ['Buck Jones', 'John Wayne', 'Edward LeSaint'],
  'genres': ['Mystery', 'Western']}]
```

#### #Q15: How many unique actor names are there in the dataset?

Think about whether you can write a function that helps you with Q15
and Q16 at the same time.

#### #Q16: How many unique genres are there in the dataset?

#### #Q17: Which movie title in the dataset appears last alphabetically?

Output should be the movie title in string format. 

#### #Q18: What is the average movie rating?

#### #Q19: What is the name of the highest rated movie?

#### #Q20: What is the oldest movie title in the dataset?
