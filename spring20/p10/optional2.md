#### Question 6: What are the top 15 countries that have the largest gap between birth rate and death rate?

You should display the `country` name, `birth-rate`, and `death-rate` of the top 15 countries that have the largest gap between `birth-rate` and `death-rate`. These top 15 countries should be displayed in *descending* order of the ratio.

**Expected output:**

#### Question 7: What are the top 15 countries that have the largest gap between birth rate and death rate? (answer with a plot)

Answer with a **horizontal bar plot**. Put countries on the x-axis and `birth-rate` and `death-rate` on the y-axis. The countries should be sorted along the x-axis in *descending* order of the gap.

**Expected output:**

#### Question 8: What is the relationship between death rates and birth rates? (answer with a plot)

Answer with a **scatter plot** with `death-rate` on the x-axis and `birth-rate` on the y-axis. Do you observe a pattern between death rate and birth rate?

**Expected output:**

Write a query with to grab rows corresponding roughly to that
rectangle to get the points.  In the output, `death-rate` should be
sorted low to high.
